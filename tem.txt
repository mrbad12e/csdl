In my database, I have a function like this:
create or replace function delete_from_cartitem(cart_id char(8), variation_id char(12))
returns void as $$
begin
    delete from cartitem where cart_id=$1 and variation_id=$2;
end;
$$language plpgsql;

In Flask, I code: 
@app.route('/remove/<string:cart_id>/<string:variation_id>/', methods=['POST', 'GET'])
def remove_item(cart_id, variation_id):
    cur.callproc('delete_from_cartitem', (cart_id, variation_id, ))
    conn.commit()
    return redirect('/cart')

It returned: 
psycopg2.errors.AmbiguousColumn: column reference "cart_id" is ambiguous
LINE 1: delete from cartitem where cart_id=$1 and variation_id=$2
                                   ^
DETAIL:  It could refer to either a PL/pgSQL variable or a table column.
