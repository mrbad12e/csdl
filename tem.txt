Fix code:
cur.execute("insert into payment (id, user_id, cart_id, amount_paid, first_name, last_name, phone, email, first_address, second_address, country, state, city) values (%s,%s,%s, %s,%s,%s, %s,%s,%s, %s,%s,%s,%s)", (id, str(user[0]), str(cartitems[2]), str(total_amount()), first_name, last_name, phone, email, first_address, second_address, country, state, city,))
conn.commit()
